# Jeroen Suurmond - Student Software Developer  

🌍 **Location:** Zeeland, Netherlands  

## About Me  

Hi, I'm **Jeroen Suurmond**, a 19-year-old creative problem solver from Goes. I have a passion for **space exploration**, **aerospace**, **gaming**, and **cars**. Whether I'm immersed in a game or tackling a complex software issue, I don't rest until I've found the solution.  

### Why Software Development?  
My dedication to problem-solving has driven me to pursue a career in software development. My dream is to contribute to one (or more) of my passion industries. However, I'm equally excited about exploring other industries and discovering where my skills can make a difference.
